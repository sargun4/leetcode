# ✔️ Solution 2: Binary Search + DFS

# Using binary search to choose a minimum threadshold so that we can found a route which absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route always less or equal to threadshold.

# Complexity

# Time: O(M * N * log(MAX_HEIGHT)), where MAX_HEIGHT = 10^6, M <= 100 is the number of rows and N <= 100 is the number of columns in the matrix.
# Space: O(M * N)
